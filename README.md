This repository contains a preliminary C implementation of the finite-temperature variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method
that is developed in the paper, "Robust Decompositions of Quantum States".
It is hard-coded for a strictly local variational ansatz and one-dimensional Ising models,
 both the classical model and the transverse-field version as a quantum model.
This implementation is not intended for sustained use, it is mainly a proof of concept.
However, it would be straightforward to modify it to generate results using the same variational form
 for other 1D spin systems with local interactions.
 
I've also included the raw data and scripts used to generate some of the figures in the paper.
